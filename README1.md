## üìú **Scripting Guidelines & Best Practices**

To ensure consistency, readability, and security, please adhere to these guidelines when contributing or writing your own scripts:

* **Shebang Line:** Always start your scripts with an appropriate shebang (e.g., `#!/bin/bash`).
* **Comments:** Use comments extensively (`#`) to explain complex logic or non-obvious parts of your script.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling (e.g., `set -e`, `set -u`, `set -o pipefail`).
* **Variables:** Use clear, descriptive variable names.
* **Input Validation:** Validate user input where applicable.
* **Security:** Avoid hardcoding sensitive information. Be mindful of permissions.
* **Readability:** Format your code consistently (indentation, spacing).
